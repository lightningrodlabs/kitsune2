//! Unit tests for the connection-reader exit cleanup, which decides whether a

//!
//! Regression context: simultaneous-open resolution produces two connections
//! for a pair and tears the losing one down. The teardown of the loser is
//! driven by the *remote* peer, so on the node whose losing connection is
//! still its active map entry — because the winning connection has not yet

//! mistaken for a genuine peer disconnect. Doing so spuriously marks the peer
//! unresponsive (which lasts until the agent info expires) and stalls gossip.
