//! Unit tests for the connection-reader exit cleanup, which decides whether a
//! reader loop ending means "the peer is gone" (mark unresponsive + fire
//! `peer_disconnect`) or "this connection was deliberately superseded" (close
//! quietly).
//!
//! Regression context: simultaneous-open resolution produces two connections
//! for a pair and tears the losing one down. The teardown of the loser is
//! driven by the *remote* peer, so on the node whose losing connection is
//! still its active map entry — because the winning connection has not yet
//! finished its preflight and registered — that remote close must not be
//! mistaken for a genuine peer disconnect. Doing so spuriously marks the peer
//! unresponsive (which lasts until the agent info expires) and stalls gossip.
