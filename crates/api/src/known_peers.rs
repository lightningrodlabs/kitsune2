//! Known-peers index types.
//!
//! The [`KnownPeers`] trait provides an append-only index of all ever-seen
//! agent infos, including those that are currently blocked.  It is used
//! purely for URL → agent-ID resolution by the access control layer so that
//! a blocked agent cannot slip through just because it shares a URL with a
//! non-blocked agent.
